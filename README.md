## 🏗️ 6. Architecture

he solution for **ABC Retail** is built in mind to be used as a **cloud-native application** utilizing **Microsoft Azure services** for maximum scalability, reliability, and cost-efficiency.

### Core Components and Application Host

- **Web Application (ASP.NET MVC/Core)**:
  - Serves as the central user interface and application logic, allowing users to interact with all backend services.
  - Designed to adhere to modern design patterns for separation of concerns and maintainability.
- **Deployment Host (Azure App Service)**:
  - The entire web application is built to be deployed here, providing a fully managed **Platform as a Service (PaaS) environment**.
  - Ensures the application is highly available and accessible via a **unique public URL**.

### Application Structure (ASP.NET Core MVC)

The application code adheres to the **MVC pattern**, which ensures a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase maintainable, testable, and scalable.

- **Model**: This layer manages the application's data and business logic. It includes the Entity Framework Core data context, the entity classes (e.g., Product, Order), and the service classes responsible for interacting with the database and external Azure APIs.
- **View**: The user interface (UI) is rendered using Razor views. This layer is responsible solely for presenting the data to the client and capturing user input.
- **Controller**: Controllers act as the entry point for handling user requests. They receive input, coordinate the necessary actions by calling methods in the Model layer, and determine which View to return to the user.

### Backend Services and Data Storage

The architecture intentionally leverages a **polyglot persistence strategy**, using the best-fit Azure service for each type of data and operational requirement:

- **Centralized Structured Data (Azure SQL Database)**:
  - Stores core relational data, including definitive customer, product, and order information, enabling complex queries and data analysis.
  - The use of SQL ensures data integrity, transactional consistency, and support for the relational data model.
- **Semi-Structured/NoSQL Data (Azure Table Storage)**:
  - Used for storing high-volume, schemaless data such as customer profiles and less frequently accessed product details.
  - Provides a cost-effective and highly scalable NoSQL key/attribute store.
- **Media and Object Storage (Azure Blob Storage)**:
  - Hosts unstructured data, specifically product images and other multimedia content.
  - Optimized for massive scalability and cost-effective storage of binary files.
- **Asynchronous Messaging (Azure Queues)**:
  - Acts as a temporary store for messages related to order processing and inventory updates (e.g., "Processing Order ID X").
  - Decouples the web application from backend processing tasks, improving performance and fault tolerance.
- **Shared File Storage (Azure Files)**:
  - Used for securely storing corporate documents, such as contracts, and application-generated log files, which require a standard file share interface.

## ❓ 9. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. Why was Azure SQL Database chosen over Azure Table Storage for core order and customer data?

**Azure SQL Database** was selected for core data (orders, primary customer profiles) because it provides a relational model with transactional integrity (ACID properties), complex querying capabilities (joins), and defined schemas essential for financial and operational reporting. **Azure Table Storage** is reserved for high-volume, non-relational, schemaless data where cost and simple key-based lookups are the main priorities.

### 2. What is the primary purpose of using Azure Functions in this architecture?

The main goal is to introduce **serverless computing** and **decouple operational tasks**. The functions handle specific, discrete tasks—like processing a message from a queue or writing a record to a storage table—without requiring a continuously running server, which significantly enhances scalability and reduces operational costs.

### 3. How is the system protected against data loss?

Data loss protection and high availability are primarily made to be achieved through the implementation of an **Azure SQL Database Replica** established in a **different geographical region**. This ensures core operational data can be recovered quickly and maintains business continuity during a catastrophic regional failure.

### 5. Where are product images stored, and how are they accessed?

Product images are stored in **Azure Blob Storage**. This service is optimized for hosting massive amounts of unstructured data. Images are accessed via unique, high-performance URLs generated by the Blob Storage service, which the web application uses for display.

### 6. What is the role of Azure Queues in order processing?

**Azure Queues** manage the **reliable flow of transactional messages** related to orders (e.g., inventory deduction, fulfillment notifications). They act as a buffer, ensuring that messages are reliably stored and delivered to the backend processing Azure Functions, preventing backlogs and system slowdowns during high-traffic events.

### 7. Why are both Azure SQL Database and Azure Table Storage used for customer/product data?

They serve different purposes:
_ **Azure SQL** holds the **relational data** (e.g., customer transaction history, product inventory levels).
_ **Azure Table Storage** is used for **supplementary, semi-structured data** like user preferences, session history, or application metadata, where massive volume and speed of simple writes are crucial.

### 8. Is it possible to execute the application locally without an active connection to the Azure Cloud services?

The **foundational web application component** can be executed locally, for instance, using a local development environment. However, any **core feature reliant on the cloud resources** - including data retrieval from Azure SQL Database, media access from Blob Storage, and the initiation of asynchronous message processing via Azure Queues/Functions will be **non-operational or disabled**. Full functionality requires connectivity to the live, provisioned Azure backend.

### 9. Is the processing and confirmation of customer orders performed in a synchronous or asynchronous manner?

Order processing is **designed to be asynchronous** to maximize application responsiveness and scalability. Upon order submission, the transaction details are **immediately placed into an Azure Queue**. This action allows the front-end web application to confirm receipt instantly.

### 10. Are the provided default user credentials suitable for use in a production environment?

**Absolutely not**. The **authentication credentials** included within the repository or initial setup files are **strictly intended for development, testing, and demonstration purposes only**. Production environments must utilize a robust set of accounts, ideally provisioned through secure management practices and possibly integrated with services like Azure Active Directory, ensuring no default or easily compromised credentials are used for live operations.

### 11. How are authentication mechanisms and data security implemented within the web application?

Security is handled through multiple integrated layers:
_ **Authentication**: The system employs role-based authentication, restricting access and functionality based on a user's assigned permissions (e.g., Administrator, Customer).
_ **Data Security**: All data transmission across the network is secured via HTTPS/SSL when published on Azure, and sensitive data stored in the Azure SQL Database benefits from Azure's platform-level encryption and management features.
